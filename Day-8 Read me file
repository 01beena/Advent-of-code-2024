README: Antinode Finder Solutions
This repository contains two Python solutions for identifying and counting unique antinodes based on a grid input from a file. Antinodes are computed based on the positions of antennas (letters or digits) in the grid.

Problem Overview
The task is to process a grid representing antennas and calculate unique antinodes for different frequencies. Each frequency is denoted by a unique alphanumeric character. Antinodes are derived by analyzing the relative positions of antennas for each frequency.

Solution 1: Unique Antinode Finder
Description
This solution calculates the unique antinodes for pairs of antennas, considering valid points within the grid's bounds. It focuses on direct and minimal computation.

Steps:
Parse the Grid: Read the grid from an input file and identify the positions of antennas for each frequency.
Compute Antinodes: For each pair of antennas of a frequency:
Compute two potential antinodes based on the relative positions of the antennas.
Ensure the computed antinodes are within the grid bounds.
Return the Count: Count and return the number of unique antinodes.
Strengths:
Efficient for calculating antinodes for small to medium-sized grids.
Focuses on antinodes based on direct antenna pairs.
Solution 2: Comprehensive Antinode Finder
Description
This solution takes a more exhaustive approach, generating all potential antinodes along the lines formed by pairs of antennas and ensuring all points are within bounds.

Steps:
Parse the Grid: Read the grid from an input file and identify the positions of antennas for each frequency.
Generate Antinodes: For each frequency:
Add antenna positions as antinodes.
Generate all possible antinodes along lines formed by each pair of antennas using a direction vector.
Ensure generated points are valid and within the grid bounds.
Return the Count: Count and return the number of unique antinodes.
Strengths:
Comprehensive; generates all potential antinodes along antenna-pair lines.
Suitable for dense grids with closely packed antennas.
Usage Instructions
Input File:

The input file should be a plain text file where each character represents a grid cell. Letters and digits represent antennas, and other characters are ignored.
Running the Solutions:

Place the input file in the same directory as the script or provide the full path.
Modify the file_path variable in the script to point to the input file.
Run the script in a Python environment.
Output:

Both solutions print the total number of unique antinodes.
