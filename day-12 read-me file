# Day 12: Total Area and Perimeter Calculation

This program calculates the total fencing cost for a garden represented as a grid. The input is a file where each cell contains a character representing a plant type. The cost is determined by multiplying the area of connected regions of the same plant type by their perimeter.

---

## How It Works

1. **Input File:**
   - The input file (`input.txt`) contains a grid of characters where each character represents a plant type.

2. **Key Features:**
   - **Area Calculation:** Uses a flood-fill algorithm to calculate the area of connected regions of the same plant type.
   - **Perimeter Calculation:** Calculates the perimeter by checking adjacent cells for boundaries.
   - **Orthogonal Directions:** Considers only up, down, left, and right movements for connected regions.

3. **Output:**
   - Prints the total fencing cost to the console.

## File Structure

- **`input.txt`**
  - The grid input file. Example:
    ```
    AAABB
    AAABB
    CCCDD
    ```

- **Script File**
  - Python script containing the main logic to calculate the total area and perimeter.

## Usage

1. Place your input file (`input.txt`) in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python day12.py
   ```
3. View the result printed to the console.

## Example

### Input (`input.txt`):
```
AAABB
AAABB
CCCDD
```

### Output:
```
Total fencing cost: <calculated_value>
```
